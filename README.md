## Caesar Cipher
This is a web application that uses the Caesar cipher to encrypt and decrypt messages. It was built using the React library and is intended to help users learn about basic encryption techniques.

### Features
* Encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm
* Support for both uppercase and lowercase letters
* Ability to specify the shift value
* User-friendly interface

### How to Run the Application
To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies by running `npm install`.
4. Start the application by running `npm start`.

The application should now be running in your browser.

### How to Use the Application
Once the application is running in your browser, you can use the Caesar cipher to encrypt and decrypt messages. Follow these steps to use the application:

1. Enter the message you want to encrypt or decrypt in the input field.
2. Enter the number of positions to shift the letters by in the key field. This number can be any integer between 1 and 25.
3. Select whether you want to encrypt or decrypt the message by clicking the appropriate button.
4. The encrypted or decrypted message will be displayed in the output field.

### Demo

### About the Caesar Cipher
The Caesar cipher is a simple encryption technique that involves shifting each letter in a message a certain number of positions down the alphabet. For example, if the shift is 3, the letter "A" becomes "D", the letter "B" becomes "E", and so on.

The Caesar cipher is easy to implement and is useful for learning about basic encryption techniques. However, it is not secure and can be easily broken by someone who knows how it works.
